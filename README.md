### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Jorge, currently working in the AI department at [@Ferrovial](https://www.ferrovial.com/) while completing my Computer Science degree at [**URJC**](https://www.urjc.es/) and programming at [**42 Madrid**](https://www.42madrid.com/), a peer-to-peer coding campus. At Ferrovial, I apply AI to infrastructure challenges, combining my academic background with practical industry experience.

I thrive on building real-world projects in AI, Linux, and algorithms, and I love the unique energy of hackathons. My approach is hands-on and collaborative, always looking for challenges that push me to grow.

Beyond coding, I love traveling, trying new recipes, reading, listening to music, learning languages, and relaxing with a good TV show or some Formula 1.

Fun fact: Iâ€™ve built a fully customized Hyprland tiling window manager setup, themed with Catppuccin for both efficiency and aesthetics.
