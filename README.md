### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Jorge, currently working in the AI department at [@Ferrovial](https://www.ferrovial.com/)
I'm Jorge, a Computer Science student at [**@Universidad Rey Juan Carlos**](https://www.urjc.es/) and a programmer at [**@42 Madrid**](https://www.42madrid.com/), an innovative peer-to-peer coding campus. I’m passionate about artificial intelligence and fascinated by how technology shapes everyday life.

I thrive by learning through building real-world projects—especially in AI, Linux, and algorithms—and I love the unique energy that comes from hackathons. My approach is hands-on and collaborative, always seeking new challenges that push me to grow.

Beyond coding, I love traveling, trying new recipes, reading, listening to music, learning languages, and relaxing with a good TV show or some Formula 1.

Fun fact: I run a handcrafted tiling window manager setup on Hyprland, themed with Catppuccin—beautiful, efficient, and always customized to my workflow.
